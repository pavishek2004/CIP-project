MODULE DESCRIPTION

1. Gathering Data:       We used a tool called Twitter Archiver to collect tweets containing specific political hashtags, like #BJP and #Congress.
                         This allowed us to identify tweets that expressed support for or opposition to various political parties.

2. Preprocessing:        Before analyzing the tweets, we removed unnecessary elements like website links, hashtags, mentions of other users, common words, emoticons, and punctuation. 
                         This helped focus the analysis on the core meaning of each tweet.

3. Negation Handling:    To accurately determine the sentiment of a tweet, we considered words expressing negation (e.g., "not", "never"). 
                         This allowed us to distinguish between positive and negative opinions, even when stated indirectly.

4. Algorithms Used:
                         i)Dictionary Approach: 
                                                Each word was assigned a score based on its positive or negative connotation using a resource called SentiWordnet. 
                                                By summing the scores of all words, we can determine the overall sentiment of the tweet.
                    
                         ii)Na√Øve Bayes Classifier:
                                                This method used probability theory to classify tweets based on the likelihood of words appearing in positive or negative contexts.
                    
                         iii)Support Vector Machine (SVM): 
                                                This powerful technique mapped each tweet into a complex space, allowing researchers to identify patterns 
                                                and classify sentiment based on these patterns.
